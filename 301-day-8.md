## 301 Learning Journal: Day-8 ##

This week seems to be going a little better than Monday. Tuesday and Wednesday was fairly easy however we were introduced to postgres and sql really fast. When we were introduced to it in class it seemed like Scott assumed we had heard about it before, even though the words look like javascript the way it works is completely different. I still feel very lost with this whole week. The content isn't hard semantically but logically I'm still in the dark about servers, ports, and the what, why, and how. I understand how to set things up, just don't understand why I'm doing things yet.

I'm starting to get nervous about finding a job. I have heard from many grads that they didn't get a job or even an interview for up to a month after graduation. Because of this I have started to do my career dev now, creating resume, linkedin, and looking at potential job offerings. I'd like to know if this is a good or bad thing to be starting so early.
