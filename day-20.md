## Learning Journal: Day-20 ##

Friday was the last day at code fellows and our group presentations. Everything went according to plan and our project actually went well. I was worried that our group would get nervous and people would get mad, but it all went accordingly. I loved my first class at Code Fellows and I want to continue learning. I have already signed up for code 301 and can't wait to graduate from it.
