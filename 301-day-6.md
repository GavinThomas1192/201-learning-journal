## 301 Learning Journal: Day-5 ##

Yesterday in class was pretty intense. It seemed like since our lab was so hard on Friday it caused a meltdown within our class. I think the main idea is that previous Friday class had been do-able. The lab on Friday basically was not able to be completed for many if not all the students and this was a wake up call that 301 just became hard and we have hit bumpy spots on the road. That being said the new schedule for our class transitioning from morning lecture to mid-afternoon lecture is pretty terrible. I can tell our class as a whole is tired, and drained by the time they get to lecture from trying to complete the lab.

I don't blame this on our teacher and I think this is a scheduling problem that has to do with the organization as a whole. Regardless I thought that the time spent yesterday could have been spent figuring out the lab and moving onto the next topic.

P.S. In case I didn't say it already the lab was hard.
