# Learning Journal: Day 2

Today we learned about the basic structure of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The lecture had some great concepts that really solidified front end theory. We touched upon some of the back end concepts like databases and servers. I am really interested in learning more about the "Back End". I really haven't seen any examples of back end code and I'm not sure what it looks like.

We also learned about GitHub. I thought Sam went through it very fast, however it made me go and look up the "cheat sheet" commands by myself. This, in turn, made me remember the add, commit, push better.

I am excited for what is to come but more scared we will cover topics I've never seen as fast as we went over Git today. I like that we have to apply ourselves to learn new concepts that get touched upon in class.
