# Learning Journal: Day-6

Today we received our assignment for the Salmon Cookies week long project. At first it seemed simple, however very shortly I realized just how much different work it would be. I really enjoyed getting this project because it feels like we are truly a freelance web developer building a website with specific requests from a customer. I think this will be fun.

In regard to the Salmon Cookie project I don't like the CSS portion of it. I feel I don't have a good eye for web design and am worried because most of my creations have looked like my 8th grade Myspace page. I am planning on keeping it stupid simple. I have thought through how I will attack this project and will most likely sketch it out on paper also with color. Creating boxes within my HTML and CSS I find challenging so hopefully drawing it out first will help.

Last week was fairly easy to be honest. Yes this school does things differently where we get an assignment we have to struggle through and I expected that. However the work load wasn't too bad. I am starting to see how everyday will start to get more and more tough as new concepts are taught and then we must use them while learning more new topics.
