## 301 Learning Journal: Day-1 ##

I am writing this on day 4 before lunch. The lab for day 3 was pretty difficult. My partner and I completed it at about 10 AM with assistance form the rest of the class and the TA's. We completed the logic but had a hard time with concatenation of the stings when dynamic content was included.
I am having a difficult time in 301 vs 201. Almost every day I ask myself where I am in the class and how well do I think I'm doing. I can't answer any of these questions because I really haven't had much feedback on how I am doing. It seemed that in 201 it was a very clear pattern. The teacher would teach, we would "do" via lab, and then we would see the correct answer the next day. 301 is much different than this pattern and I am trying to adjust. I do believe 301 has many lessons to teach and I will continue on acting as if this will be like my normal work environment when I get a career.
