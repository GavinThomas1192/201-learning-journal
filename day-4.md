# Learning Journal: Day-4

It's not quite Friday yet however I will consider this the end of the week. Man, my mind has been blown. I am still sticking to my guns and say that I really enjoy coding or at least the very basic stuff we have done. It feels really satisfying to start out with a blank screen and watch it fill up. As with my other comments I am excited to move past my extensive knowledge with "Alerts" and "Prompts", they have overstayed their welcome.

I want to learn about the DOM, or maybe its JQuery in order to start doing better things. For example on my about me page I want to run a JS function when they click a photo. I am trying to figure out how to do this now but it's not coming together as planned.

Today we worked partner programming for the first time. I enjoyed it, I liked working with a partner for the social aspect of it. I did not like that our work speeds didn't match very well. One of us worked much faster than the other at different things and it created bottlenecks in our work flow. I am certain that partner programming slowed down my work production today. If paired with a partner that was much higher skill level than me, such as a jr and senior dev I think I would love it. Overall I would like to partner program again.
