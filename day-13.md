#Learning-Journal Day 13:

Now it all makes sense. When I first started 201 I was pretty overwhelmed as it was a ton of information and new things to learn. At the second week I thought to myself this is going to be pretty intense if we have to keep learning like this. However ending week 3 I see that this was just a teaching style. Overload, then let review all the information learned, apply said information into mini projects.

I feel like I learned a ton of information and can actually use it to do things now! The Cookie Store project was great for learning methods and then the Bus Mall was even better because we were left to use our newly found skills to create the app.

I am also excited for project week. I think It will be a great learning experience. The group atmosphere does worry me. Sometimes I feel I work better alone because I can get stuff done faster. I hope that our group will be focused on completing the project as fast as we can.
