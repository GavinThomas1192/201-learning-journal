# Learning Journal: Day-15

On Friday we got to start our group projects. Our group decided on a plan rather quickly and we started our work right away. I am worried about our group dynamics because we have four very strong personalities. This was already apparent on Friday when we all had our personal ideas and I could tell it was hard for people to mold each other ideas into their own.

I'm pretty excited on our project because it seems pretty straight forward and easy at the moment. I am planning to write most of the javascript for this project. Writing javascript is my thing, I think its more interesting and honestly easier than CSS. I love writing JS because its like a puzzle that I need to solve with each new function one more piece to completing the puzzle.
