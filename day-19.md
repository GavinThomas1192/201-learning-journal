## Learning Journal: Day-19 ##


Today was the easiest day in regards to things to finish and hardest with interpersonal issues. It seems like one of our team members always disagrees with my opinion, so, in attempts to just finish things I told them to just decide. This caused some arguments and it wasn't a good thing.

I have learned very important lessons from this group project over the week. Interpersonal issues will be the hardest thing to deal with. Most would say, including myself that I could have just finished the project faster myself however I have learned this isn't a good thing. By learning to work with a team, efficiently and quickly, you can finish just as fast AND have the input and collaboration of everyone in the group.
