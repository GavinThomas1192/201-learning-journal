## 301 Learning Journal: Day-5 ##

I felt pretty confident in the beginning of last week only to find myself not so optimistic by the end of the week. I'm having a hard time adjusting to the fact that our lab's kinda have to do with lecture but a lot of them leave it up to us to find out what and how to do things. I know I'm learning more through this style of teaching, however because I'm always feeling lost it creates this sense of failure of lack of understanding. This in turn makes me feel like I'm behind.

Another thing that is starting to become harder for me is when we get our lab and most of the code and or functions are already written. Now i'm not complaining that I have to do overall less work rather when jumping into the lab I really have to read the functions for a while to understand what is going on.
