## Learning Journal Day-16 ##

Today is Tuesday the second day of project week. I was super excited for project week at first but I have realized it is much more difficult to work in teams. Everyone has their own work flow, style, and speed. This is proving difficult. I think everyone in our group is smart, and we have a strong product but we all want to do things our way. My biggest problem is that I want to get done as fast as possible and It set my group off in a negative way. I am going to work on taking my time and realizing it doesn't have to be finished today.

On a side note, Passing my 301 test I'm assuming I will be taking 301 and this is great. I'm pumped to learn more Javascript as I feel comfortable right now but want to learn more!
