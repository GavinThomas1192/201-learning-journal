## 301 Learning Journal: Day-1 ##

Today seemed to flow just like any other first day of school. It felt slow for me. I liked that we already had two assignments to complete. The main let down was our schedule, in 201 we had lecture in the morning and then was left to do lab throughout the day after lunch. I Liked this because I don't take a lunch and was able to work through increasing my work productivity. I will take this as an opportunity to embrace change and adapt to my working environment. This will ultimately be a skill that is necessary in this field of work. Who know's it might even work better because I won't have to take any of my work home with me due to the morning lab time.
