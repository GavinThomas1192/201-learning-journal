#Learning Journal Day-9:

What a week. There was a lot of hype about how hard week two is which caused me to be pretty nervous prior too. Now that it's the end of the week i'd say it wasn't as hard as I expected. It more or less was slightly overwhelming because of all the new topics we covered and the workload for the first three days.

I really enjoyed the project because it was something I hadn't ever done before. I figured out that I do not like doing CSS. I kind of feel like its a big waste of time as in I spend a ton of time at it because I'm not skilled at it. I would say I prefer doing javascript because there is no web design portion of it. I'm excited for our group projects coming up.
