## Learning Journal: Day-17 ##

I am writing this after Tuesday of project week. Today was pretty rough for me because I worked on adding a delete button for our journal entries. This seemed easy at first but because I became un organized and attempted to try multiple ideas without deleting old ideas things became scattered. When group members tried to understand what was going on they also got confused. Sam had us leave our computers and white board our problem which really turned out to be pretty simple. I was upset I spent so much time on a portion of code that should have only taken an hour.

Our plan for Wednesday is to finish the CSS. I don't think we have enough time to finish it all by today however everyone else in our group feels that we can.

Our group has discovered that we like to do Mod programming with the whole group on the projector so that everyone feels like they know whats going on. I'm sure we will do this from now on.
