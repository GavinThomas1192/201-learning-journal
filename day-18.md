## Learning Journal: Day-18 ##

Today was the best day so far within project week. Because we already had most of our JS completed all we needed to do was agree on a design and then implement that design to the other pages. As a group we made the homepage and then split off so that we could pair program the other two pages to best use our time. Again, everything went pretty smoothly with only slight bumps when trying to decide on certain design elements. I'm glad we got most of our project done yesterday so today we can test the problems that we may encounter while presenting.

Our group came up with an idea for the about me page to promote same sex everything in spite of a certain class mate and I don't really agree. This classmate, as annoying as they may be, has never been rude or said anything about same sex topics and I don't understand why the group decided to do this.
