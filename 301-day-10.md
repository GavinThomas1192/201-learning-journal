## 301 Learning Journal: Day-10 ##

This week was probably the hardest of all 301 for myself. It started fine but once we learned about SQL things got weird, yes, weird. It seemed like I was understanding everything but I often was asking myself "why" are we doing this? It was hard to see how to implement stuff until the very last couple of hours on Friday when I could finally see how SQL would be used in queries.

No matter how many times this pattern happens at code fellows I always seem to forget. Things get hard, then harder, then a day to recover. I am starting to like this. Even though I feel like I can't possibly be remembering everything that is getting taught, I am retaining more than I think.

I am going to keep trekking forward and no matter what maintain a great attitude, because that is the only thing that would hold someone back from learning.
