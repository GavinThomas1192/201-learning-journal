#Learning Journal: Day-10

Today is the end of the second week in code 201 and it was actually fun! I enjoyed today a lot and even though we have a lot of homework for the weekend its very exciting. I find it exciting because I really feel like a web developer with several projects going on. We have a deadline and must manage our time accordingly.

I am starting to see a pattern here at code fellows where we are asked to do something we don't know how to do correctly, fail at said task, then shown the better way. Sam taught about wireframes and css, which was great. I learned a lot, more importantly I learned that I was doing CSS all wrong!

After the chocolate cookie assignment I feel much more confident in my ability to render a styling webpage. My style has a long way to go because most of my designs don't look very professional.
