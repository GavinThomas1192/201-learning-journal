## 301 Learning Journal: Day-13 ##

Today is Thursday and only one more day from Friday! I can see how people would start to get worn down and I'm personally looking forward to our two week break very much! I'm anxious about project week and I feel like my final project isn't going to be much better than our 201 project.

I had my one on one with Scott yesterday and It went well. We talked a little about job searching and I just want to be graduated so I can go find a job. Finding a job is causing a ton of angst currently and once this is complete I think I will finally be able to relax.
