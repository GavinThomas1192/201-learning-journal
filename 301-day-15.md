## 301 Learning Journal: Day-15 ##

I am writing this on Sunday immediately after taking the 401 entrance test. I feel pretty terrible about the test. I scored 76% and was stressing the whole time. Initially I didn't take it as serious as needed and I got a couple questions wrong too soon. I even got one question wrong that was directly from the past quizzes! Due to my score dropping quickly I had to skip over the hard questions and focus on the easy ones. Then I had to calculate exactly how many more questions I could get wrong and still pass.

I am writing all this because I felt confident after the 301 test, it was actually easy. It instilled confidence in myself and I felt like I was where I needed to be. After this 401 test I'm afraid I'm falling behind. I missed a lot of jQuery questions which I thought I understood pretty well.
